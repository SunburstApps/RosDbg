## [ReactOS](https://github.com/reactos/reactos) Remote Debugger

ReactOS Remote Debugger is a debugging shell that can take protocol modules (currently only for talking to KDBG), .nostrip files from the ReactOS build, and aggregate information in a way that is a bit impractical in KDBG. It is a Windows forms application (C#) with a number of window types, a simple poor man's dockability, and tabs.

It has a local variables window, backtrace, debug interaction, threads, and processes. It can display a lot of info and will become more useful as features are fleshed out.
